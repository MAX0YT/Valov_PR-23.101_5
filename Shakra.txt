"Poshanka! Edges sharp and senses keen! In my land, that is the way warriors greet each other. For though you are a child barely hatched, you are also a warrior. Your stance, your weapon, your movements all proclaim it so."
"In these lands names are given freely, are they not? I am Shakra, Wielding Rings. If our hunts intertwine again, I will have new maps to trade. Until then, farewell, Child Wielding Needle."
